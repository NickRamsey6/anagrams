#### By _**Nick Ramsey**_

## Description

## Specs

| Behavior | Input | Output |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| Check if two words are anagrams | "Listen" "Silent" | These words are anagrams |
| Account for different casing | "LiStEn" "silent" | These words are anagrams |
| Check if inputted words are actual words | "bzmnp" | You need to input actual words |
| Check if two words are antigrams | "Hi" "Bye" | These words are antigrams |
| Find anagrams in multi word strings | "go hang a salami" "im a lasanga hog" | These words are anagrams |
