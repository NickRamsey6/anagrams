# _Anagram Checker_

#### _Find Anagrams_

#### By _**Nick Ramsey**_

## Description

_For my first Ruby code review, I am created an application that will take in user inputted words or phrases and evaluate them for anagrams._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Visit my git hub repository: <a href="https://github.com/NickRamsey6/anagrams">GitHub Repo</a>_
* _Clone the repo_
* _git clone https://github.com/NickRamsey6/anagrams
* _bundle Install_



## Specs (Initial, May Change)

| Behavior | Input | Output |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| Check if two words are anagrams | "Call" "All" | These words are anagrams |
| Account for different casing | "CaLl" "alL" | These words are anagrams |
| Check if inputted words are actual words | "bzmnp" | You need to input actual words |
| Check if two words are antigrams | "Hi" "Bye" | These words are antigrams |
| Find anagrams in multi word strings | "Do good" "Dog" | These words are anagrams |



## Known Bugs - UPDATE

* _Pulls from the first office it finds so may not be local_
* _Div does not clear after multiple searches_
